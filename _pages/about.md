Wenyu Chen is a second year PhD student in the department of Statistics, University of Washington. Prior to graduate studies, I graduated from the University of Chicago with BS in Computational and Applied Mathematics and Statistics in June 2017. 

## Research

I am currently working on causal graphical models. Specifically, I am interested in making causal conclusions with high-dimensional data. My other research interests include distribution-free prediction, multiple testing, and (causal) machine learning. 

I am currently advised by Prof. [Mathias Drton][https://www.stat.washington.edu/~md5/Home.html] and Prof. [Ali Shojaie][http://faculty.washington.edu/ashojaie/].
